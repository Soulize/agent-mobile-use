     *    No numeric dump ids, no label/contains guessing — a wrong guess here used to

     * 2. ACTION_SET_TEXT exactly once, then read the node back and classify:
     *      ok, no error              -> verified (read-back equals input)
     *      ok, verify_unavailable    -> written but not comparable (masked / unreadable /

     *      !ok, no_focused_input     -> nothing editable is focused; includes focus_hint
     *      !ok, target_not_found / ambiguous_target / target_not_editable

     *      !ok, verify_mismatch      -> read-back differs; before/after evidence attached
     * 3. NO FALLBACKS: no tap, no clipboard, no side-effect retry. A failure is
     *    reported with evidence instead of being papered over by the next strategy.
     * 4. If submit is true AND the write succeeded, dispatch KEYCODE_ENTER.
     * 5. Return structured JSON with the classification and before/after evidence.
